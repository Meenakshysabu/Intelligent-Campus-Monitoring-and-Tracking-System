# 🎓 Intelligent Campus Monitoring and Tracking System

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
**"Intelligent Campus Monitoring and Tracking System"** is our mini project—an AI-powered solution designed to enhance campus security and automate student tracking through real-time facial recognition. It replaces manual and RFID-based systems with a contactless, accurate approach—detecting unauthorized entries or exits during class hours and instantly notifying faculty via a web dashboard. Built for smarter, safer, and more efficient campus management.

## 🔧 Methodology (with Technologies)

### 📂 Dataset Preparation  
- **Tech Used:** Python, OpenCV  
- Captured multiple face images per student using a webcam  
- Organized images into folders: `"StudentName_RegistrationNumber"`

### 🧼 Preprocessing  
- **Tech Used:** OpenCV  
- Resized all images to 112×112 pixels  
- Applied:
  - Histogram Equalization  
  - Data Augmentation  

### 🧠 Model Training  
- **Tech Used:** DeepFace, ArcFace  
- Used pre-trained ArcFace within DeepFace for facial embedding  
- Trained on the student dataset to improve recognition accuracy

### 👁️ Face Detection  
- **Tech Used:** OpenCV, MTCNN  
- Captured live video at the college gate  
- Detected and aligned faces using MTCNN

### 🧾 Face Recognition  
- **Tech Used:** DeepFace, ArcFace, Cosine Similarity  
- Compared detected faces with stored embeddings  
- Retrieved student info if matched  
- Flagged as unauthorized if no match found

### 🔄 Real-Time Monitoring  
- Continuously monitored student movement  
- Logged entry/exit time automatically in the database

### 🌐 Web Dashboard  
- **Tech Used:** PHP, MySQL, HTML 
- Central platform for faculty and HOD interaction

**Faculty Dashboard:**  
- View and update student records  
- Mark informed entries/exits  

**HOD Dashboard:**  
- Receive real-time alerts  
- Access detailed movement logs

### 🚨 Alert System  
- **Tech Used:** Web Notification  
- Automatically triggered for unauthorized entries/exits during class hours  
- Includes:
  - Student’s Name  
  - Department  
  - Roll Number  
  - Timestamp  
- Instantly sent to the HOD dashboard for action

## 🌱 Future Scope

- **Mobile Application Support**  
  Develop a mobile app for faculty and HODs to receive real-time alerts and manage student records remotely.

- **Multi-Location Camera Integration**  
  Extend the system to support multiple camera inputs for monitoring different campus gates or buildings.

- **Visitor and Staff Monitoring**  
  Expand facial recognition to track staff and visitor movements for complete campus security coverage.

- **Parent Notification System**  
  Enable automated SMS or email notifications to parents for repeated unauthorized student movements.

- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**  
  Introduce visual reports and insights such as movement patterns, peak hours, and attendance trends.
